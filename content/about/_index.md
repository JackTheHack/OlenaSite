I am a creative based in Tauranga and work with clients both local and worldwide to design beautiful and functional experience. 

As a graphic designer with a Diploma in Applied Computing and a Master's degree in social science, my main focus is designing for web and apps applying UX principles. However, I am still able to assist you with your marketing and branding needs like logos, flyers, posters, brochures etc.  

No job is too big or too small. Get in touch for a quote or to discuss any ideas you might have so I can help you to create an outstanding design.

## **MY APPROACH**


From research to prototype... I believe that all good designs have scientific data in the background. That's why I always start my work from deep research on user experience to look for the best practices in the industry to help you to show your brand from the best side. 

I also believe that prototyping is one of the most crucial stages of the design. That's why I start to make it during the wireframing stage, which helps to check the visual balance and test the tiny details of the user experience. 

I mostly work with Adobe Creative Suite, but I am always open to explore and try new tools if you prefer them. 





## **MY PHILOSOPHY**


"There is a lot of art in design. But, art is not design and design is not art."
Art is a creative expression to provoke questions. Design is a creative process of solving a problem. Art is inspiring and emotional. Design fills a need for people who will interact with it. Art creates questions. Design creates answers. Even though art and design are two different things, they perfectly complement each other.
