Hi there! 

Let me introduce myself. My name is Olena Spektor. I am a UI/UX designer based in sunny New Zealand's  Papamoa. 

I began my journey as a designer when I was studying Computing in Toi-Ohomai, Tauranga. I received valuable coding and web design skills that now helps me to understand the backstage of the development process much more in details and apply this knowledge to the design process. 

My area of expertise is on websites and mobile apps design. However, no job is too big or too small. I can also help you design logos, business cards, flyers, posters, brochures and more.
