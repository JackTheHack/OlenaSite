Hi there! Let me introduce myself. My name is Olena Spektor. I am a UX/UX designer based in sunny New Zealand's "Gold Coast", Papamoa. 

I began my journey as a designer when I was studying Computing in Toi-Ohomai, Tauranga. I received valuable coding and web design skills that now helps me to understand the backstage of the development process much more in details and apply this knowledge to the design process. 

My area of expertise is web design and mobile app design. However, no job is too big or too small. [Get in touch](https://www.olenaspektor.com/contact/) for a quote or to discuss any ideas you might have so I can help you to create an outstanding design.
