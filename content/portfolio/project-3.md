Renarta Creative Hairdressing is a locally based hairdressing business in Tauranga, which needed to refresh its logo. I rebranded the original company logo and assisted in building the brand.

The rebranding process consisted of updating the font to be more readable and modern. The new logo also needed to portray the hairdressing industry, so, as the client requested, the scissors were kept on the logo to represent the ‘hairstyling’ part of the business.  

The logo which has been developed portrays a simple, easy, elegant with a bit of boldness brand. The focus of the logo has been placed on scissors as the illustration of the hairdressing industry.
